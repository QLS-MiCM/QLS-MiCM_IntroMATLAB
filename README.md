# Intro to MATLAB
This 4-hour hands-on workshop will introduce participants to MATLAB, one of the most well-known programming languages for technical and scientific computing. The workshop will cover MATLAB programming fundamentals, such as arrays and matrices, variables, functions, control flow and operators, and so on. Participants will also learn how to use MATLAB for data analysis and visualization.

 ## Learning Objectives
 
- Understand the MATLAB workspace and its basic functionality and syntax, including matrix operations, which form the basis of calculations in MATLAB
- Learn how use the command line, create MATLAB scripts and functions and perform numerical calculations using each of these tools
- Learn how to input and visualize data in 2D and 3D
- Know where to find additional MATLAB toolboxes for statistics, advanced data visualization, machine learning, image processing, and so on.
 
## Prerequisites:

  - Some basic understanding of general programming concepts- for/while loops, if/else statements, etc.
  - Participants must install MATLAB on their computer before the workshop.
  - Workshop materials for Intro to MATLAB workshop on February 18th, 2025.
